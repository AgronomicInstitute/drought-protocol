## drought-protocol
A SCIENTIFIC-BASED PROTOCOL FOR THE CALCULATION OF TWO STANDARDIZED DROUGHT INDICES USING NASA-POWER DATA 

This R-script uses the 'PlotData', 'ScientSDI', and OperatSDI functions from the PowerSDI package and 
applies them to the pixel corresponding to -48.11ยบ longitude and -24.81ยบ latitude (State of Sao Paulo, Brazil). 
This R-script can be easily adapted/applied to other regions on the planet.
The PowerSDI package is available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PowerSDI/index.html and
